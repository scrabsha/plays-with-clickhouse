# `scrabsha/plays-with-clickhouse`

This repository contains a bunch of experiments with the clickhouse Rust crate.
It aims to be a simple playground for me to experiment with, possibly helping
other people in the future.

Don't expect any kind of stability there.

## Experiments

This repository is a cargo workspace where each member corresponds to a
different experiment. They are listed above:

| Member name | What to see in there |
